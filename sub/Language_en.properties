ExtName=IBM Globalization Delivery
ExtDesc=IBM Globalization Delivery provides machine translation and editing capabilities that enable you to rapidly create, maintain, and revise translations for your Bluemixâ„¢ application. This extension allows for the application developer to dynamically translate property files using machine translation. The application developer can either include updated property files directly in the application package, or the application can use dynamic resource bundles for real-time lookup of strings.
